# this code uses attr_accessory commands and def and classes . it is pretty clean .
# however it has so many missing features. such as we can't save it database yet.
# or we can't give restriction for user entries such as don't use numeric or symbol etc.
# we can make it looking more good looking if we use screen area adjustments.
